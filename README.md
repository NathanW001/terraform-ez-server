# Terraform EZ Server

This is a project using Terraform with the aim to simplify cloud hosting using the free tiers of popular platforms.

## How to use

When you clone this repo, you only need to keep the subfolder of the service you are planning on using, and you can delete the others.
You are required to have [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) installed.

From here, proceed into the subdirectory of your cloud platform of choice and follow the instructions there.

*For now, I've only had enough time to add AWS. In the future, I hope to cover more platforms as well.*
